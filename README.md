# Graph Traveller

A Dijkstra algorithm implementation which is able to handle queries on big map (more than 110 MB).
A course project for ECE 368.

## Goal

* Implement Dijkstra algorithm for big graph with 200,000 vertices.
* [More information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mr_PvxzUplXQqSu_vtzU1ZXFm0FxeEMPRvm75C6xtH4/edit)

## Performance Tuning

### Prerequisite

* [Memory_Profiler](https://github.com/pythonprofilers/memory_profiler)

### Command

```{shell}
# Measure memory usage
make memory-compare

# Measure the time used to process queries.
make linux-compare
```
